## 🧠 How It Works

This tool evaluates the complexity of a password based on 5 core criteria:

| Criteria                         | Points |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| Length of at least 8 characters  | ✅ +1   |
| Contains lowercase letters       | ✅ +1   |
| Contains uppercase letters       | ✅ +1   |
| Contains numbers                 | ✅ +1   |
| Contains special characters      | ✅ +1   |

- The score ranges from **0 to 5**, determining the strength label:
  - 🔴 0–1: Very Weak
  - 🟠 2: Weak
  - 🟡 3: Moderate
  - 🟢 4: Strong
  - ✅ 5: Very Strong

- A color-coded progress bar reflects this score visually.
- A dynamic suggestion list helps the user improve the entered password.
